## Learn Objective-C: Escape Sequences and Format Specifiers

`NSLog`, and its corresponding C function `printf()`, use escape sequences to print certain characters that are “invisible.” For iOS, include:

| Sequence | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `\b` | backspace | 
| `\f` | Form Feed |
| `\n` | Newline |
| `\t` | Horizontal Tab |
| `\v` | Vertical Tab |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\'` | Single Quote |
| `\"` | Double Quote |
| `\?` | Question Mark |

There are others, such as `\a` for Alert, but they are rarely used, and don’t make an effect.

Format specifiers, however, are the percent character, followed by a letter, such as `%d` or `%f` that tell `NSLog` or `printf()` to print the value or result of a variable, value, and/or expression.

Just think of them as types of placeholders, each designed to represent a different value.
