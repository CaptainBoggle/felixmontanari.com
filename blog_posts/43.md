## Learn Objective-C: Reserved Keywords

Objective-C reserves certain words, so that you can’t, or shouldn’t, use them in your own code. At best, you’ll get a compiler warning or error; at worst, you’ll get a nasty bug that you won’t discover until millions of people are already using your app. Here is a list of reserved keywords, to help you avoid that pitfall.

| Words You *Can't* Use | Words You *Shouldn't* Use |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| auto | BOOL |
| break | Class |
| case | bycopy |
| char | byref | 
| const | id | 
| continue | IMP | 
| default | in |
| do | inout | 
| double | nil | 
| else | NO |
| enum | NULL |
| extern | oneway | 
| float | out |
| for | Protocol | 
| goto | SEL |
| if | self | 
| inline | super |
| int | YES |
| long | @interface |
| register | @end |
| restrict | @implementation |
| return | @protocol | 
| short | @class |
| signed | @public | 
| sizeof | @protected |
| static | @private |
| struct | @property |
| switch | @try | 
| typedef | @throw |
| union | @catch() |
| unsigned | @finally |
| void | @synthesize |
