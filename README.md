### About

After Binpress went down, I did my best to clone the [Learn Objective-C in 24 Days](https://web.archive.org/web/20170426001334/https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/learn-objectivec-in-24-days/38) series. All credit goes to the original author. This project was created with the intention of preservation.
